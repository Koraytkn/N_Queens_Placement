I have written my code in Python in order to compile and run for part1 using pyhthon3.10
	python main.py part1
after this run, 3 .txt result files for n 6,8,10 will be created in the same directory with main.py and the requested console output of LasVegas probabilities will be written 

In order to execute part2 using python3.10
	python main.py part2
after this run, the probabilities and success counts for different n and k values as requested can be observed as concole output.
